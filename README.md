## Task 1 - Configure and Document the Repository
Recommended additions to the project to achieve production-readiness:

- [x] **Version Control Support**
	- [x] Git tracking
	- [x] Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude `dist/`, `node_modules/`, etc., from being checked in.

- [ ] **Environment Configuration Support**
	- [ ] Add a `.env` file to contain:
		- Backend API and third-party service URLs
		- Environment modes (development, test, production)
		- Database configurations (host, port, username, password)
		- Application secret keys (JWT secret, OAuth keys)
		- Feature flag configurations

- [ ] **Build Process**
	- [x] Set up `tsc` for TypeScript transpiling
	- [ ] Add `webpack` for:
		- Code splitting
		- Minification
		- Module bundling
		- Hot reloading

- [ ] **Code Formatting**
	- [ ] Add `prettier` to enforce code formatting standards, to be run on commit hooks using tools like `husky` and `lint-staged` before a remote push.

- [ ] **Testing**
	- [ ] Add unit tests for existing, uncovered functions
	- [ ] Add automated integration testing

- [ ] **Deployment**
	- [ ] CI/CD Pipelines: Outline integration with services like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.

- [ ] **Monitoring and Analytics**
	- [ ] Add logging and monitoring options (e.g., Sentry for error tracking or DataDog for performance monitoring) to track errors and performance in production.
